# 🛒 Copilot Workshop: Webshop Showcase

An interactive workshop that teaches GitHub Copilot features — **copilot-instructions**, **agents**, **skills**, **commands** (`/explain`, `/fix`, `/tests`), and **MCP servers** — using a real webshop application as the demonstration vehicle.

**Stack:** Vite + React + TypeScript · Kotlin + Spring Boot · H2 Database

## What you'll learn

This workshop focuses on **Copilot features and patterns** you can apply to any project:

| Feature | What it teaches |
|---------|---------|
| `copilot-instructions.md` | How to encode project knowledge into a persistent, reusable system prompt |
| **Skills** (`.github/skills/`) | How to package domain knowledge into specialized personas (frontend-engineer, backend-engineer, designer) |
| **Agents** (`.github/agents/`) | How to create autonomous task-runners (todo tracker, code review, etc.) |
| **Inline completions** | How Copilot uses instructions + context to generate code suggestions |
| **Chat commands** (`/explain`, `/fix`, `/tests`) | How to use Copilot for code understanding, debugging, and test generation |
| **`@workspace`** | How to enable cross-file understanding in chat |
| **Code review agent** | How to automate quality gates (bugs, logic errors, regressions) |
| **Playwright MCP server** | How to connect Copilot to external tools (browser automation, testing) |
| **`copilot-setup-steps.yml`** | How to pre-configure environments for automation |

The **webshop** is a real-world codebase used to demonstrate these features in practice — a backend API, frontend UI, and database layer that creates a need for all the Copilot patterns.

## How to Use This Workshop

**If you're learning Copilot features:** Complete Parts 01–04 sequentially. Each part focuses on a specific Copilot capability (instructions → skills → commands → agents/MCP). The webshop stubs are your vehicle for practice.

**If you're setting up your own project:** Study how this project uses `copilot-instructions.md`, skills, and agents. Copy these patterns to your codebase — the webshop is a template, not the end goal.

**Key mindset:** You're not building a finished webshop. You're learning **how to make Copilot effective** across the full stack. When you finish, you'll know how to apply these patterns to your own projects.
